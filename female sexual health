## Female sexual health

Adapted from https://www.mazewomenshealth.com/whats-new/resources/sexual-health-inventory/

- I had sexual feelings or fantasies once or more times a day
- When I have sex with my partner I always get turned on
- My orgasms were excellent
- I was in the mood to have a sexual encounter with my partner once or more times a day
- When I have sex with my partner I keep aroused and lubricated until we finish
- When I start fantasizing about sex, I always get wet, tingly and aroused
- Intercourse is pleasurable and there was never pain
- I reached an orgasm every time when I had sex
- When my partner approached me for a sexual encounter I was happy to have sex
- It was easy to have an orgasm every time when I self-stimulated
- It was easy to say yes when my partner approached me and sometimes I’ll initiate sex with my partner
- When I have sex my arousal can be described as high
